                            topics such as Differences between Bribery/Embezzlement/Extortion/Tips and their

                            months, and write journal on the book. The books are usually in the categories such

                        <p>Volunteers from GOCEF Leadership Club
                            go to secondary schools to mentor younger generations in becoming a patriotic citizen
                            as well as effective leaders.
                            In order for this to be effective, we engaged both the Teachers and the Students in the
                            workshops.
                            The training for the teachers are on different days from the students.</p>

                            Glorious Trinity Fashion to teach tailoring for 6 months and the best student was
                            sponsored by GOCEF to go for additional 9 months training and GOCEF
                            presented her with a brand new sewing machine at the end of the full training. As
                            time goes on, GOCEF was able to get volunteer trainers to train people at
                            GOCEF Center. At each Training session, there’s 1 hour interactive discussions
                            on Business/Life Skills or Some challenges facing Nigeria that affect growth of
                            businesses.</p>

                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Grace Oluwakemi Christian Empowerment Foundation (GOCEF), formerly known as Grace Oluwakemi Christian Institute is an NGO in Lagos, Nigeria, and was established on June 22, 2013.

                        GOCEF was built on the legacy of Late Evangelist Grace Oluwakemi Olayoriju nee Oluata.
                        
                        GOCEF majorly focuses on alleviation of poverty, jungle justice, and corruption. We do this through skill acquisition programs, assistance in education, Petty trade funding, reorient people through seminars/workshops, and mentorship. 
                        
                        Our programs/services are 100% free of charge for the past 7+ years.
